# Bomb-O-Clock
Being one of the themes of the Erasmus+ project "Fostering the Transversal Digital Competences in Higher Education”, Bomb O’Clock was a group project, implemented in C++ utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It
proposes an interactive learning platform based on gamification, with the primary objective of helping users assimilate
information from educational modules. To achieve this goal, a captivating, simple, and efficient game has been developed,
which integrates a timing system ("beat the bomb") to add pressure and increase user engagement.
